## Project Overview
### Introduction:
Welcome to the bustling shopping scene of Istanbul! This project delves into the rich shopping landscape of Istanbul, focusing on data collected from 10 prominent shopping malls spanning the years 2021 to 2023. Our comprehensive dataset encompasses a diverse range of shoppers, capturing insights from various age groups and genders to provide a holistic view of shopping habits in this vibrant city.

### Dataset Overview:
- The dataset comprises vital information crucial for understanding Istanbul's shopping dynamics. It includes details such as invoice numbers, customer IDs, age, gender, payment methods, product categories, quantity, price, order dates, and shopping mall locations.
