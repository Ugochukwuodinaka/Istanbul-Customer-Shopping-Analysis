- **The Total Revenue By Shopping Mall Location:**
- This, in my estimates, will give a category-by-category price breakdown at the shopping mall level, providing relevant information on consumer spending and behavior for these various retail destinations within the Istanbul region. Every shopping mall represents an individual shopping environment, each catering to diverse demographics and tastes of the local population.
- __Mall of Istanbul: ₺50,872,482__
_Mall of Istanbul comes out to be the highest revenue outputting mall in this case, portraying high popularity for consumers in a first position for a shopping destination in Istanbul due probably to its vast retail mix or prime location or strong campaigns.
- __Kanyon: ₺50,554,231__
- Kanyon outpaces the Mall of Istanbul in this ranking, underlining its strong appeal and competitive position in the retail landscape of Istanbul. With its well-known innovative architecture and upscale shopping experience, Kanyon caters more to an affluent group of shoppers in pursuit of luxury brands and upscale amenities.
- __Metrocity: ₺37,302,787__
This places Metrocity third in terms of total revenue, pointing further to the fact that it is one of the most visited shopping malls in Istanbul. Within the lively business district of Levent, Metrocity combines retail, dining, and entertainment activities for a large population of working professionals, residential homes, and tourists.
- __Metropol AVM TL: 25,379,913__

- **Total Revenue By Payment Methods & an Analysis of Variations in Istanbul Shopping Behavior Based on Payment Methods:**
- Information regarding the breakup of total revenue by means of payment is very considerate. It shows the major trends in consumers' payment preferences and behavior in Istanbul. A deep understanding of all these variations could only help retailers and businesses better accommodate these different means of payment into daily life and enhance the overall shopping experience for consumers.
- __Cash Payment: ₺112,832,243 (44.86%)__
Cash is the most used method of payment, which straightaway hints that a great number of consumers in Istanbul prefer doing business using real currency. This disposition toward cash payments could be impelled by several factors:
    - __Cultural factor:__ Cash payments give way to traditional Turkish customs and cultural norms, where use of physical currency often seeks preference in transactions.
    - __Privacy and Anonymity__: Cash transactions provide customers, particularly those seeking steady privacy in their financial transactions, a level of anonymity.
    - __Financial Control:__ Some other consumers may like to pay through cash to exercise control over their spending so they will not incur any debt since transactions are limited only to available funds.
- __Credit Card: ₺88,077,124 35.02%__
Next to cash, credit card transactions come second in general revenue, reflecting the popularity and absolute need for electronic methods of payment in Istanbul's consumer behavior. The preference for credit cards can be conditioned by the following:
    – __Convenience__: Credit cards are an easy means of making payments for goods and services, with consumers not having to carry money on their persons.
    - __Rewards and Benefits:__ Many credit cards come with rewards, cashback, or loyalty points; therefore, consumers are inclined to use credit cards for their purchases in order to derive these benefits.
    - __Financial Flexibility:__ Credit cards allow consumers flexibility in terms of paying for purchases over time through an installment plan or a revolving credit line, thereby making them the better planners of their money.
- __Debit Card: ₺50,596,427 (20.12%)__
• Another large share of total revenue comes from debit card transactions, thereby evincing that debit cards issued by banks are tremendously popular with consumers in Istanbul for making payments in this city. This preference towards debit card payments could be driven by the following factors:
    – __Direct Access to Funds:__ Debit cards give everyday customers direct access to funds from their bank accounts, thus providing an easy and efficient way of making payments.
    - __Security and Fraud Protection:__ Debit cards involve secure PIN authentication and fraud monitoring that would encourage customers to make any purchases with a great deal of confidence.
    - __Budget Management:__ With debit cards, consumers' expenditure will be confined to the money available in their accounts, hence fostering prudent spending behavior without the risk of falling into debt.
<br />
<br />

- <img src="images/Shopping_By_Gender.jpg" width="250">

- **Total Revenue By Gender Shopping & an Analysis of Variations in Istanbul Shopping Behavior Based on Gender:**
- In my analysis, is the distribution of total revenue based on how much is contributed by the different genders, thus giving insights into the shopping behavior and preferences of consumers in Istanbul: 
- __Females: ₺150,207,136 (59.72%)__
  - The major contributors in this instance, females, clearly indicate the great purchasing power and influence that females have in the retail landscape of Istanbul. The reasons that can justify their great influence can be attributed to:
    - __Fashion and Beauty Preferences:__ Women possess an aspiration towards fashion, beauty, and personal care leading to higher sales in such categories.
    _ __Lifestyle and Household Purchases:__ Besides, the female consumer might also be the lead in purchasing household items, groceries, and other family-oriented products, reflecting their caregiving role and decision-making in household spending.
    - __Shopping Activity and Frequency:__ Shopping is more engaging for females than males. Therefore, these are the prime customers for your retail business, where you play with promotional offers, loyalty schemes, and targeted marketing campaign strategies to woo them.

- __Shopping by Males: ₺150,596,427 (40.28%)__
  – Males reflect a high percentage of total sales, though below the females by a small extent, hence an important consumer segment in the Istanbul Market. Shopping Patterns for Male's Candidates may be influenced by:
    - __Technology and Electronics:__ Men are real gadget lovers, electronic enthusiasts, and game lovers as well. Usually, this results in remarkable sales in the category. Retailers can always capture the hearts of male consumers by making a good range of technical products and accessories available all the time.
    - __Sports and Leisure:__ Men consumers may show dominance in buying sports equipment, outdoor, and leisure use gear. This would reflect their interest in physical fitness and recreation.
    - __Shopping Preferences and Convenience:__ Men may have different shopping appetites as compared to women, believing in the doctrine of simplicity, worth, and convenience in businesses.

<br />

- <img src="images/Total_Revenue_By_AgeBand_%26_Product_Category.jpg" width="500">

- **Total Revenue By Age Band and Product Category:**
- The analysis thus allows one to disaggregate total revenues by age band and product category, thus capturing the diverse shopping habits and tastes of many demographics that make up the sprawling metropolis of Istanbul. It is then possible to gain insight into consumer trends by looking at the various correlation channels between demographic factors—age-band, gender, and product category on total revenues, and understand how best to adapt marketing strategies accordingly.
- __Young Adults:__ Young adults form a large proportion of contribution to total revenue, particularly across categories such as clothing, shoes, and technology. Typically aged 20 to 39 years, this demographic group makes up one key segment with tastes and spending powers that vary greatly. From the part of young adults, trendsetting fashion and gadgets in tech and lifestyle products will call the shots on sales performance in the respective categories.
- __Middle-aged Adults:__ Middle-aged adults are the runners-up in generating the most money, and they have similar preferences: clothes, shoes, and technology products. Indeed, this age segment comprises a more stable and wealthy stratum with established purchasing habits. Quality, comfort, and practicality will, therefore, be highly regarded by middle-aged adults in the choice of goods to buy, hence regularly earning sales in apparel and footwear.
- __Old Adults:__ This segment normally includes 60-plus-year-old people who generate cash in most categories but at a comparatively lower spending level than the young adult demographics. It can be perceived that old adults are more conservative in their shopping behaviors and tendencies. Comfort, durability, and value for money are the premier factors in their purchasing behavior, which translates to stable sales in categories like clothing and shoes.
- __Teenagers:__ Adolescents are a smaller but equally important percentage of total sales. These age groups are most keenly interested in purchasing clothes, shoes, and technology. This demographic generally includes people from ages 13 through 19 years, which is a young and trend-oriented consumer crowd with money to spend via allowances or part-time jobs. Therefore, teens will be interested in fashion clothes, shoes, and the latest gadgets in technology, hence pushing sales in such categories.

- <img src="images/Total_Revenue_By_Gender_%26_AgeBand.jpg" width="350">

- **Total Revenue By Age Band and Gender:**
- The findings also illustrate the added value of the information contained within the analysis that details out how the revenues are bifurcated by different age brackets and genders, outlining shopping patterns within these diverse demographic segments of Istanbul. We will also discuss which demographic segments have contributed most to consumer spending and how marketing strategies might best be focused towards those segments in a more directed fashion.
- __Females Aged 20-39 Years,__ Young women are integrated as the dominative increment of sum revenues, attesting to their buying power and accordingly, their effect on a retail setting in Istanbul. This age group typically consists of women who are 20-39 years of age. More holistic preferences are presented as clear potential, belonging to an age segment that presumably will buy fashionable clothing, beautifying products, and lifestyle items. Young women from 20 to 39 years old would probably spend on trendy clothes, cosmetics, and all the accessories associated with it.
- __Mid-aged Adult Females:__ Typically, these are the second-largest category that generates the most total revenue. This indicates their high purchasing power along with diversified shopping tastes. Generally, this group encompasses women between 40 and 59 years of age. Women belonging to this group portray mature and sophisticated purchasing behavior oriented towards quality, comfort, and practicality. For example, mid-aged adult females would prefer buying wardrobes, skincare products, and home goods that drive sales in these categories.
- __Mid-aged Adult Males:__ Mid-aged adult males too generate significant gross revenue but slightly less compared to the adult females. This target group comprising men from 40 to 59 years of age enjoys Technology gizmos, Sports supplies, and useful Lifestyle accessories as products the most. Mid-aged adult males are very particular about usefulness, efficacy, and price-worth, quality; hence, this segment is sure to see no decline in sales over time.
- __Young Adult Males:__ Young adult males are the second in line in total revenue generated after mid-aged adult males; this proves that they are responsive to tech-savvy gadgets and fashion. Typically within the age bracket of between 20 to 39 years, this consumer class forms a shopping behavior characterized by youthfulness and exuberance, having interests in the latest gadgetry, streetwear fashion, and experience purchases. Young adult males may be really into gadgets, streetwear, and entertainment products.
- __Old Adult Females and Males:__ Old adult females and males contribute towards the overall revenues from all categories of products due to the fact that old adults are never out of the consumer market. Their conservative approach to shopping and product likeness may be stronger for the age bracket of 60 years and above. The old adult persons look for comfort, durability as well as convenience based products, hence reflecting stable outputs into categories like clothing, footwear, and home utility products.
- __Female and Male Teenagers:__ Female and male teenagers form a relatively small yet, at the same time, a significant portion of the overall revenue, where interests are focused on fashion, technology, and entertainment. A lot of young teen behavior, which identifies with this age group between 13 and 19 years, characterizes this section by purchasing patterns that are in fashion in clothes, gadgets, and entertainment products.
<br />
<br />

- <img src="images/Total_Revenue_By_Shopping_Month.jpg" width="500">

- **Total Revenue By Shopping Month Trend:**
- From my analysis, the total revenue by shopping month trend clearly shows changes in customer behavior and spending patterns across the year in Istanbul.
- __January—Highest Revenue:__ On this measure, January will turn out to be the month producing the highest total revenue; it indicates that consumer spending at the beginning of the year is very strong. This might have been due to New Year sales, winter fashion item purchases, and post-holiday shopping.
- __February:__ February is very close to January in terms of total revenue, capturing strong interest and momentum in consumer spending. This may be heavily influenced by Valentine's Day promotions and winter-related purchases.
- __March:__ March depicts a slight fall compared to January and February. This may be due to the fact that winter would be transitioning into spring, and thus consumer shopping priorities change.
- __October:__ It is during October that the total revenue surges exponentially, likely with the impact of fall fashion launches going on, back-to-school shopping, and probably early shopping for the upcoming holiday season.
- __July, May, and December:__ July, May, and December show slightly higher total revenues, which could indicate seasonal peaks and particular events that drive consumer spending. July can anticipate increased sales from summer vacations and seasonal activities. Some pre-summer and Mother's Day-related purchasing occurs in May. The higher revenue for December can be attributed to the fact that it is the month of holidays and festive shopping.
- __August, June, and September:__ It has moderate total sales in August, June, and September, keeping the shopping behavior almost stable.
- __April and November (Lower Revenue):__ April and November revenues reflect lower total revenues, thus indicating a period when the shopping calendar is quieter.
